Literature Review III

For my third literature review, I decided to delve into the concept of visualization. I work as a full stack engineer at a bioengineering firm and a lot of my day to day job is taking massive sets of data and transforming the data into digestable pieces of content, so I'm extremely interested in the cutting edge tech when it comes to data visualization. 

The first article I decided to read for this literature review is Toward measuring visualization insight, an article which delves into the philosophy of visualization. The author speculates that the core purpose of visualziation is to provide insight into a particular set of data, which I can agree with. The notion I really enjoyed was how the author further went into the word 'insight' and explored just what 'insight' is defined by. They were able to give 'insight' several traits - insight is complex, meaning it incorporates several different types of data which might not be obviously related. Insight is deep, meaning it is carefully curated over time. Insight is qualitative, meaning it is not an exact science and it can be heavily subjective. Insight is often unexpected, which is something I can personally relate to - some of my biggest "Ah ha!" moments have been totally out of the blue. Lastly, the author states that insight is relevant, meaning it delves deeper into just columns, rows, and numbers; it takes these abstract pieces of data and can export a digestable piece of *something* which you can grow from. 

The author then goes on to speak about various methods of evaluating if your visualizations are actually effective or not. As software engineers, we can get really lost in the 'how' and lose our goal when we're building these beautifully complex analytic systems. It's not really to a fault of our own, afterall we've been trained to be obsessed with the 'how', but it's essential for us to objectively analyze our results. The author details several ways to test visualizations; controlled experiments, usability testing, longitudinal studies, heuristic evaluation and cognitive walkthroughs are the most popular. They further go on to highlight some of the issues evaluators face when they're evaluating a visualization, which I thought was pretty interesting. The biggest issue with judging something like a visualization is that the people who are skilled enough to judge something so technically complex might also be *too* skilled to be able to judge the visualization fairly. An example of this would be a data scientist who worked with the engineering team to create a visualization, but they're aware of certain shortcomings the visualization may have and they can subconsciously 'work around' the shortcomings. 

Moving onto my second article, it was an article which spoke about data visualization in the Medical industry. The medical industry has undergone a rapid and massive technological renaissance within the past decade, with Big Data and the Internet of Things paving the way. Many hospitals have now signed contracts with massive Software As a Service (SaaS) companies which aim to become the ubiqitious solution in the medical space. The future in medical technology is coming; a future where you can go to a hospital in Boston one day and Bangladesh the next, where the Bangladesh hospital will see the exact same patient data on the exact same platform as the Boston hospital. 

As one can imagine, this has been a massive technological undertaking and has pushed the bounds of data visualization technology. Creating a single platform that can be used across the globe in order to convey information that could be the difference between life or death has been no easy feat. One of the first deep dives into medical visualization technology were applications which focused on 'Patient-Centered Point-of-Care' applications; basically applications that Doctors and nurses would use to see information on a patient, like their medical history or their perscription history. This sounds relatively simple, but the feat of getting the doctor in Boston to take medical notes in a similar fashion to the one in Bangladesh has been a challenge which has elevated past simple language barriers and put into the hands of revolutionary data visualization and user experience. 

A key piece of this article is the act of getting the two doctor's to cooperate in a similar fashion, which I thought reminded me of my first article where they extensively go into validating their visualizations. At the core of any data visualization is the data, and at the core of that, is the user inputting the data. If the data is no good, then obviously the visualization will be useless. It goes to note that it does not matter how much we advance our technological means of displaying and relaying information if we do not have the discipline within ourselves to always ensure the quality of data is as high as it could possibly be. I thought that was a really important sentiment to take away from these two articles and I'll strive to incorporate it into my own life.
